This is a copy from the traversy's media 
video express js crash course: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L72fhGm1tfE&t=2498s&ab_channel=TraversyMedia
(all credits to him of course)

The reason im pushing this here is to keep 
track of the things im learning

i didnt keep the handlebars stuff cause the syntax its not up to date
(neither the bootstrap)
the video is from 2019 so most of the syntax its not the same
like the require/import stuff

since i didnt fix the handlebars syntax i cant do the form things too.
